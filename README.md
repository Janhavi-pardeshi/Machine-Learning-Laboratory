# Machine Learning Laboratory

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Laboratory**! This repository contains a collection of hands-on experiments designed to help you understand and apply key concepts in Machine Learning.

## Experiments Overview

1. **Uber Price Prediction**  
   In this experiment, we will use linear regression to predict Uber ride prices based on features like distance, time of day, and ride category.

2. **Email Spam Classification**  
   We will build a classification model using Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression to identify whether an email is spam or not, based on its content.

3. **Gradient Descent Implementation**  
   Here, we will implement the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch, learning how to optimize a cost function iteratively.

4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
   This experiment focuses on implementing and understanding the KNN algorithm, which is used for both classification and regression tasks.

5. **K-Means Clustering**  
   In this experiment, we will explore unsupervised learning by implementing the K-Means algorithm to group data into clusters.
